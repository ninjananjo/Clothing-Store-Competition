    "### Popular times, wait times and visit duration\n",
    "To help customers plan visits to your business, Google may show information including popular times, live visit information, waiting times and typical visit duration. This data appears below your regular business information on Google Maps and Search and can help customers plan their visit. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### About visit data\n",
    "To determine popular times, waiting times and visit duration, Google uses aggregated and anonymised data from users who have opted in to Google Location History. Popular times, waiting times and visit duration are shown for your business if it gets enough visits from these users. You can’t manually add this information to your location, and it appears only if Google has sufficient visit data for your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visit data may include:\n",
    "Popular times graph: Shows how busy your location typically is during different times of the day. Popular times are based on average popularity over the last several weeks. Popularity for any given hour is shown relative to the typical peak popularity for the business for the week. For example, in the image below, 6:00 p.m. – 7:00 p.m. on Thursday is one of the more popular times of the week for this business. \n",
    "Live visit data: Shows how active your location is right now. Live visit data is updated in real time and overlaid on the popular times graph. For example, in the image below, the highlighted section of the graph represents how active the location is right now compared to its usual level of activity.\n",
    "Visit duration: Shows how much time customers typically spend at your location. Visit duration estimates are based on patterns of customer visits over the last several weeks.\n",
    "Wait time estimates: Shows how long a customer would have to wait before receiving service during different times of the day, as well as the peak waiting time for each day of the week. The displayed waiting time is based on patterns of customer visits over the last several weeks. Waiting time estimation differs for different business types. For instance, a sit-down restaurant's waiting time reflects how long customers wait before being seated. Whereas, a grocery shop's waiting time reflects how long customers wait to check out their items.\n",
